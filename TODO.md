### TODO ###

- Shoot using click or space or whatever. Shooting can just be a ray-cast.
- Shooting all your ammo will require a reload. Display how much ammo you have via HUD.
- Look into using the Animation/Animator functionality for shooting and reloading animations.
- Move around the game world, but add stuff you can't move into; handle the collisions.
